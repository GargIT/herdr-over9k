# Claude Code's subagents for a transcript ($1), from <transcript>/subagents/:
# one line each, tab-separated: id, last write (seconds), description, type,
# model, when it started (seconds), its context (the last request's input
# tokens), effort, context window, and 1 once it's done.
# Done: the parent was told so (a "finished", killed or failed notice for its
# task id; one waiting on work of its own isn't, though it writes nothing
# meanwhile), it was stopped (TaskStop: its notice only comes at the parent's
# next turn), it handed its report back (a message from it), or it never
# replied (two minutes on: a leftover, not one that runs). A signal only counts
# if the subagent has written nothing since: one told to carry on (SendMessage)
# runs again, with the old "finished" still in the parent's transcript. The parent's
# transcript (big) is read once for all of them; the answer is kept until it or
# a subagent's file changes, or for a minute at most.
# The parent's transcript only grows, and can reach hundreds of MB: its done
# signals are kept (a .state file, with the bytes read so far), and each run
# reads only what was added since; one that got shorter or starts differently
# was written anew, and is read from the top. What a subagent's own file says
# is kept too (a .seen file), until that file changes.
